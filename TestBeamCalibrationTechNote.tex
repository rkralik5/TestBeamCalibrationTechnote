\section{Introduction}
TO DO:
\begin{itemize}
\item Divide the motivation to abstract (why do we care about test beam calibration, what did we do and how did we do it. What are the results)
\item and introduction (brief history of test beam calibration, maybe a bit more detail into why is test beam calibration imporant)
\end{itemize}

Why is Test Beam?
"The idea, as with any test beam experiment, is to expose a detector to a beam of very well-characterized particles, so that we can improve our understanding our how the detector responds to such particles. We make use of upstream detectors to collect data on the beam particles before they interact in the NOvA detector. For example, we will be able to see what a 1 GeV proton actually looks like in our detector, without having to simulate it, and we can test how well we would have reconstructed the energy using our existing techniques. We may find we are able to make improvements to our tools to better match what we see in the detector with how we reconstruct it. Or we may find we already do a pretty good job. Either way, with a full cross-comparison like this, we can be more confident in our analysis of the data and reduce the level of uncertainty we consider are associated with the relevant measured quantities. Ultimately, the aim will be to reduce the level of uncertainty on the neutrino oscillation analyses and to make even better, more accurate measurements of the Standard Model."%[https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/novatestbeam/wiki/Introduction_to_Test_Beam_for_Analyzers]
Why is Test Beam calibration done:
\begin{itemize}
\item To be able to directly compare TB to the standard detectors
\item To be able to verify our calibration procedures using TB data
\item To study the particle response as a function of energy 
\item To determine an energy resolution
\item To compare currently used energy scales to data and understand if we can use TB data for absolute energy scale in all NOvA detectors
\end{itemize}

%Only considering improvement in the calibration systematic uncertainty, the NOvA Test Beam program can reduce the overal systematic uncertainty for the main NOvA measurements by about 10\% [docdb:33012] (talk also contains a list of other talks on impact of TB in different NOvA areas). 
For DeltaM2: By increasing exposure, total syst. error decreases by (+) 18.5% (-) 25%; By increasing exposure and reducing calib systs., total syst. error decreases by: (+) 26% (-) 32%; Difference between the above (reducing calib systs. with large exposure): (+) 9.6% (-) 9.4%.
For sin2Th23: Difference by reducing calib syst.: (+) 10.8% (-) 9.4%.
Statement: “The NOvA Test Beam will improve the total systema6c error on the final measurement of the oscilla6on parameters Dm232 and sin2Th23 by 10% from reduc6on of calibra6on systema6cs alone. Further, NOvA analyses will benefit from the detailed understanding of detector response to hadronic, electromagne6c, and muon energy provided by the Test Beam, which will be essen6al to solidify understanding of systema6cs, uncover poten6ally new uncertain6es, tune the simula6on modeling, and improve reconstruc6on and PID algorithms.”
Potential Test Beam impacts: Check modeling of hadronic interacOons in detector (check GEANT systemaOcs), Using Test Beam data as “single-parOcle MC” to train CVN prong-like algorithms, GeneraOve Adversarial Networks for MC improvements using Test Beam data, Check ND calibraOon procedure to try and understand causes of 3-5% discrepancy between data and MC for muons and protons  (Birks suppression measurement), Data/MC comparisons of observed and clustered visible energy to improve dead material correcOons and energy esOmators, Acquire beier understanding of gain and photon transport, aienuaOon, Cherenkov light modeling, [DifferenOal] charged pion and proton cross secOon measurements would be extremely useful!, CalibraOng with test beam muons vs. cosmic muons (differences between horizontal vs. verOcal muons? - possibly shed “light” on the calib shape uncertainty), Study path length inside cell, take beam data with non-orthogonal incidence, Cross-check pi0 invariant mass reconstrucOon and Michel tagging efficiency/spectra, Use neutron source to study modeling of neutron capture (I don't think this was done in the end...), Playing with different GEANT physics lists to boost our confidence in the MC (pions? neutrons?)

%[docdb:25074 - The NOvA Test Beam program paper for DOE] Improvements which enable these physics milestones include reduction of the experiment systematic uncertainties of which many are related to the energy calibration of the detector... Achieving 3sigma CP sensitivity requires all of the above factors; a failure to reduce systematic uncertainties puts this opportunity out of reach. The NOvA test beam effort will provide tagged electron, muon, pion, and proton beams which will enable a detailed understanding of the detector’s muon energy scale, electromagnetic and hadronic response in addition to providing real data for the detailed study of particle identification techniques. Muon energy scale, hadron energy scale, and scintillation model uncertainties combine to contribute 90% of the total systematic error budget for sin2 th23 and would directly benefit from test beam data. A reduction by half would keep them comparable to the final statistical precision of the experiment. Recent oscillation analyses have had to account for large differences between data and simulation in the hadronic energy recorded in the near detector through changes to the detector response and neutrino cross-sections. Our calibration systematic uncertainty is dominated by a 5% difference between the calibrated detector response for muons and protons. Energy calibration and detector response contribute 50% of the total systematic error in electron neutrino appearance. Improved understanding of the detector response will help factor the product (flux × cross-section × detector response) improving future cross-section measurements. The most important impact on the electron-neutrino appearance measurement will likely be the opportunity to verify and improve particle identification algorithms.

%[docdb:15750 - NOvA Test Beam task force report]: The test beam program was included in the NOvA proposal [1] and was considered as an essential part of the experiment since its inception. The main tangible result of these initial plans and later discussions was a production of special small extrusion modules, made at the end of the modules production stage, as possible components of a future test beam detector. In fact, this production followed and was based on initial simulations of a possible test beam experiment [5]. rimary goals are oriented toward measurements of detector response to different particles with a range of momenta most relevant to NOvA beam physics studies, establishing of the absolute and relative energy scale of both NOvA detectors, and validating detailed and fast detector simulations code. [List all possible desired studies with Test Beam copied below] Two 31-layer 2 × 2 blocks, with approximate dimensions of 2.6 × 2.6 × 4 m3 were produced at the Minnesota factory before its shutdown (as a comparison, the 3 × 3 NOvA ND has 6 × 32 layers). In addition, 96 1 × 1 layers, with approximate total dimensions of 1.3 × 1.3 × 6.2 m3 were produced. Both 2 × 2 blocks and all the 1 × 1 layers were leak-tested. The 2 × 2 blocks are currently stored at the MINOS surface building, while the 1 × 1 layers are stored at the CDF building(?). The proposed detector to be deployed for the test beam run consists of the two 2 × 2 blocks. The NDOS decommissioning yielded 25000 gallons of scintillator. Since storage available is limited to 12000 gallons, it was decided to blend most of the 5000 gallons of existing ND/FD scintillator with the NDOS scintillator. 200 gallons of ND/FD scintillator, which has a slightly higher photon yield, are reserved for special studies. We also plan to reuse the NDOS secondary containment tub to provide oil+scintillator containment in case the test beam detector undergoes a catastrophic structural failure. Based on MINERvA’s experience, it is anticipated that two months of data taking would provide the necessary samples to carry out the test beam objectives.

\section{Overview of the Test Beam detector}
%What is Test Beam, how does the detector and beamline look like.
%Placed in MC7b together with a beamline instrumentation (no need to describe beamline).

The NOvA Test Beam detector is a scaled down version of the Near and Far Detectors shown on figure \ref{figTBDetector}. It is placed in the MC7b enclosure of the Fermilab Test Beam Facility in the path of the MCenter beamline with a variety of beamline detectors to measure and identify a range of particles with various momenta \cite{NOVA-doc-22172-v2}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{Plots/TestBeamDetectorWithArrows.png}
\caption{Comparison of Test Beam detector scale to the Near and Far NOvA detectors (and a man, giraffe, or Mary Poppins). Also shown are the Test Beam beamline detectors and components (not to scale), with arrows showing the direction of the beam. The three black arrows show the orientation fo the detector coordinate system.}
\label{figTBDetector}
\end{figure}

Maybe also mention the specific times Test Beam detector was operational.

Majority of the Test Beam detector and it's instrumentation is identical to the other NOvA detectors, but there are a few differences, including size, scintillator oil used, readout electronics, or environmental controls, that we're discussing in this section.

Should I aslo talk about the beam halo? Could that have an influence on the calibration? Maybe it's the peaks in the cosz distribution?

\subsubsection*{General parameters}
The NOvA Test Beam detector consists of two 31-plane blocks, each beginning and ending with a vertical plane, with an additional horizontal plane glued inbetween them to preserve the alternating arrangement \cite{NOVA-doc-29543}. Each plane consists of 2 modules side-by-side and each module is made up of 32 cells. Each cell has an inner (without the PVC) depth and width of $5.9\,\unit{cm}$ and $3.8\,\unit{cm}$ respectively, same as for the other NOvA detectors, and a length of $2.6\,\unit{m}$. This brigns the final dimensions of the Test Beam detector to 63 planes $\times$ 64 cells, or $2.6\times 2.6\times 4.1\,\unit{m^3}$.

The 63 planes are numbered from 0 to 62, with even numbers corresponding to vertical planes and odd numbers to horizontal planes. Cells are numbered 0 to 63, going from bottom to top for horizontal planes and left to right, when facing the front of the detector, for vertical planes.

The detector coordinate system is illustrated on figure \ref{figTBDetector}. It is centered with $\left(0,0,0\right)$ in the centre of the first plane \cite{NOVA-doc-58388}. The x axis runs left to right when facing the front of the detector, y axis bottom to top, and z axis goes along the beam direction from front to the back of the detector. The exact geometry of the Test Beam detector from several alignment surveys is saved in gdml files and used in our analyses \cite{NOVA-doc-57955}.

In the past we encountered an issue when aligning the Test Beam detector with the beamline measurements broke several assumptions within the Test Beam geometry \cite{NOVA-doc-58388}, which manifested as uncalibrated cells in the back of the detector \cite{NOVA-doc-57516-v2}. This was fixed by realigning both the detector and the beamline based on the last alignment survey and implemented in the production tag R23-04-05-testbeam-production.a and there after \cite{NOVA-doc-58388}.

Should I define w here? And tehn mention it in the readout section to say that readout is always on the positive side of the detector.
Additionally we use the coordinates measured by cell number V and the distance along the cell length W independent of the view in question. Extensive use of W is made throughout this document and the code. Note: W is not the distance to the readout, it is simply an alias for x or y, so W = 0 is at the cente of detector. It happens that the readout and coordinate system are arranged such that more positive values of W are closer to the readout.

\subsubsection*{Scintillator}
The Test Beam detector is filled with (more than) three different versions of the NOvA scintillator, which differ mainly in the way they were stored since the filling of the near and far detectors. This is illustrated on figure \ref{figScintillators}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Plots/TestBeamScintillatorOils.png}
\caption{Uncorrected energy response in the centre of cells across the Test Beam detector showing a clear distinction between the different scintillator oils.}
\label{figScintillators}
\end{figure}

The original plan \cite{NOVA-doc-34196} was to use the scintillator from a tanker and one of the tanks located outside in Fermilab. First tests showed acceptable results and the tanker oil was used to fill out almost the entirety of the first block of the detector (first 32 planes) \cite{NOVA-doc-38349}. However, when we loaded the oil from tank two into the tanker, it became extremely cloudy and unusable, possibly due to contamination with water accumulated at the bottom of the tanks, which was mixed with oil by the pump. The rest of the first block was the topped up with high quality scintillator from NDOS, which has been stored inside in barelles at MiniBooNE \cite{NOVA-doc-33012}. This is labeled as "Fermilab ND+NDOS oil" on figure \ref{figScintillators}.

%NDOS+ND scin3llator were stored in MEast tank farm in translucent tanks open to the atmosphere in 2016 [docdb:41229]
%docdb:41229 actually contains a pretty good description of the whole story

%First Tanker (2730 gallons pumped) used to fill 97.5% of first block ... Missing ~2.5 gallon top-off... Decided to use reserved NDOS 55-gallon drums... Used 65 gallons for detector, 11 gallons to clean up fill lines

Even before the extreme cloudiness was discovered, it was known that the oil from the tanks has lost much of its original light yield properties. Reasons vary from water contamination to insects and dirt contamination \cite{NOVA-doc-34046-v2}. Yet it was still decided to use the tank 2 oil \cite{NOVA-doc-34196}. It was also decided not to mix the various oils (tanker/tank/NDOS/Ash River) as studying energy deposition in different types of oils could lead to some interesting insights \cite{NOVA-doc-34046-v2}.

%"One of the promising studies we see coming out of this is to understand the differences in performance for different type of energy depositions of scintillator A vs B vs C. " [docdb:34046]

The first 21 planes of the second block (planes 32 to 52) were filled with the Far Detector production scintillator shipped in from Ash River \cite{NOVA-doc-41961}. This oil has been stored in "totes" inside a building and under several layers of black plastic \cite{NOVA-doc-34067}. Also used a little (70 gallons) scintillator from NDOS to fill these planes (compared to 1900 gallons from Ash River) \cite{NOVA-doc-41961}.

The last 10 planes (planes 53 to 62) \cite{NOVA-doc-41961} were filled with scintillator drained from NDOS stored in Texas A\&M University and University of Texas at Austin \cite{NOVA-doc-38740, NOVA-doc-39088}. This scintillator has higher light yield than the one from the tanker, but lower than the Ash River one \cite{NOVA-doc-38740}.

%[docdb:38349] 2730 gallons of scintillator transferred to detector from the tanker. On April 16, circulated 20 gallons from tanker, and took scintillator sample. Extreme cloudiness meant 0\% light transmission (>=95\% required). Strongly suspect problem due to water accumulated at the bofom of tankers vented to the atmosphere since 2016, mixed with oil by pump. Used 2/4 reserved NDOS 55-gallon drums for top-off...  completed top-off of all Block 0 modules

In total the Test Beam detector is filled with 5418 gallons of scintillator oil with a weight of approximately 28.6 tons \cite{NOVA-doc-29543}.

\subsubsection*{Readout}
The Test Beam detector uses in total 126 front end boards (FEBs), each reading out signal from 32 cells (half of a plane) \cite{NOVA-doc-29543}. The readout is located on the top and right (looking on the front) side of the detector. 118 FEBs are version 4.1, same as in the Far Detector, and 8 FEBs, located on planes 16, 17, 48 and 49, are version 5.2, same as in the Near Detector. The Near Detector FEBs are designed to read out data in a fester rate and we used a mix of FEB types to study the difference in their response and to validate both versions in the same environment \cite{TeresaThesis}.

%The Near and Far Detectors use different front-end electronics since they handle different data volumes; the Test Beam Detector is instrumented with both types to facilitate a complete characterization of both NOvA neutrino detectors. [NOvATestBeam.pdf - Mike's proceedings]

\subsubsection*{Environment}
Unlike the near and the far detector, the Test Beam detector does not have any overburden to shield it from cosmic particles. 

%Is the HVAC the only systema that is controling the environment at MC7b?

%From docdb:29543
Temperature very stable during winter months (heaCng is installed at MC7). However, dew point went over 10C ND shutdown threshold several times.
%Alex'es summary in docdb:30750:
%Ordered HVAC unit with electric reheat and dewpoint control, in essence over-cooling to maintain dewpoint then reheat to maintain temperature.

%Can I describe what is the shielding in MC7b? What is the white stuff from? It's basically the only thing shielding the detector from the cosmics and temperatures. Also need to say there is an HVAC system

%Placed in the Fermilab Test Beam Facility with no overburden. Describe environmental controls, temperature dependence etc. Maybe add plots from environmental control (temperature differences etc.) with descriptions of where were the readings taken.

\subsubsection*{Underfilled cells issue}
The Test Beam detector is slightly tilted around the Z axis by about 0.7$^{\circ}$ towards the readout. This caused the top cells of both modules of all the horizontal planes (cells 31 and 63) to be underfilled, creating an air bubble on the left side of the detector and severly affecting the energy response in those cells \cite{TeresaThesis}. This has been fixed \cite{NOVA-doc-49439} by adding extensions to the filling ports and overfilling the horizontal cells with the NDOS scintillator stored in drums Fermilab (not the scintillator store in a tanker or tanks). This scintillator was also used in the first half of the detector (Fermilab ND+NDOS oil on figure \ref{figScintillators}), but is different from the "Ash River oil" used in part of the second half of the detector (bright part of figure \ref{figScintillators}). The overfilling was done in April 2021 in 3 stages in between the full operation of the Test Beam detector.

%The detector is tilted around z axis towards the readout by about 0.7 degrees (the largest tilt is for the 11th plane of 0.79330 degrees. The ND has an oposite tilt of -0.2515 degrees on average (but also the readout is on the opposite side, so is it actually the same tilt?). Correcting this by 8 degrees would require lifting the east edge by at least 3.66cm, or to correct it to the ND tilt by lifting the east edge by 4.17cm. [docdb:47491 - this is the original talk by Teresa explaining the tilt on 21st Sep 2020]

%Also need to mention that the detector was then overfilled [docdb:49439 or 49827] but with a scintillator from the NDOS drums, causing the discrepancy between the high quality Ash River scintillator and the NDOS scintillator. But need to mention this after the scintillator part.
%The overfilling was done in three stages:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Overfilling the back 9 horizontal and the 7th horizontal from the front by April 21st
%\item Overfilling of the 15 front cells (except the 7th, which was already done, and the 14th, %with problems drilling vent hole) by April 27th
%\item Overfilling of the remaining 8 horizontals by April 30th
%\end{enumerate}

%From Teresa's thesis:
%The pitch and yaw of the detector was 2.464◦ around x and 0.487◦ around z. Roll (around beam direction) of each plane. Unfortunately, the direction of the roll means the east side of the detector is slightly lower than the west side. The east side is where the readout and fill ports for the scintillator are. As a result, the top cell in each horizontal module is underfilled, with an air bubble on the west side.

\section{NOvA calibration process}
Test Beam is following the same ideas and procedures as the standard NOvA calibration. This section intends to provide only a brief overview of the NOvA calibration. Further details can be found in the other NOvA calibration technical notes \cite{NOVA-doc-13579}.

The purpose of calibration is to make sure that we get the same amount of energy wherever or whenever it's deposited in whichever of NOvA's detectors and to express this energy in physical units. The NOvA calibration uses cosmic ray muons, which provide a consistent, abundant and well-understood source of energy deposition and consists of two closely connected parts \cite{NOVA-doc-7410}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textbf{relative calibration} corrects for attenuation of scintillator light as it travels through the cell to the readout, as well as for differences between detector cells.
\item This is followed by the \textbf{absolute calibration}, which only uses stopping muons when they are minimum ionising particles and calculates a scale between the measured charge readout, corrected by the relative calibration, and the simulated energy deposition in physical units of $\unit{MeV}$. This scale is calculated for each time period and each detector separately, which ensures the energy deposition is directly comparable wherever or whenever it occured.
\end{enumerate}

There is also \textbf{timing calibration}, which corrects for the time differences of the signal to be processed and is done as a separate project to the relative and absolute calibrations and is out of scope of this technical note \cite{NinerThesis}.

%Should I talk about drift now already?

%Calibration is necessary to convert electronic signals to physically meaningful energy in units of GeV. Two calibration steps precede the calorimetric energy calibration. First raw ADCs (Analogue Digital Conversion) are converted to units of photo-electrons (PE) using the known average response of the APDs; secondly an attenuation calibration corrects for the position dependent response [6]. A drift calibration may be included in the future to correct for changes in detector response over time. The calorimetric energy scale calibration is the last step in the calibration chain and the detector response should already be uniform in space and eventually also in time. [docdb:13579 - FA\_Calorimetric\_energy\_scale]

%Using the average expected APD response, integrated charge from the ADCs are converted to units of photo-electrons (PE) [SA Absolute energy scale]

%I think I should actually include some kind of a description of the ADC to PE conversion.
\iffalse
The scaling of the ADC to PE depends only on the gain and the version of the FEB. Otherwise it's just a very simple scaling (explain this at the PE definition):
\begin{equation}
PE=\frac{\textsf{peakADC}}{\textsf{ADCPerPE}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\textsf{ADCPerPE}=\textsf{Gain}\times\frac{4095}{ADCScale}
\end{equation}
where ADCScale is 217000 for FEBv4.1 and 204800 for FEBv5.2.
\fi

%The PECorr scaling is 75.0 (NDOS), 37.51 (ND), 39.91 (FD) and 39.91 (TB)

The units and varibales used to define energy deposited in NOvA detectors are listed in table \ref{tabCalibrationVars}:
\begin{table}[!ht]
\centering
\def\arraystretch{1.4}
\begin{tabular}{m{0.1\textwidth} m{0.86\textwidth}}
ADC & The digitized charge collected by the APDs from the \textbf{A}nalog to \textbf{D}igital \textbf{C}onverter \cite{NOVA-doc-13518}.\\
PE & Number of \textbf{P}hoto \textbf{E}lectrons. Calculated by a simple rescaling of the best estimate of the peak ADC. The PE per ADC scale only depends on the FEB type and the APD gain settings. This is technically done before the calibration and serves as the base unit for calibration.\\
PECorr & \textbf{Corr}ected \textbf{PE} after applying the relative calibration results. The correction is a ratio between an average energy response (a pre-determined semi-arbitrary number) and the result of the the relative calibration fit (also called attenuation fit), which depends on w, cell, plane, epoch and detector. This makes the energy response equivalent across each detector.\\
MEU & \textbf{M}uon \textbf{E}nergy \textbf{U}nit is the mean detector response to a stopping cosmic minimum ionising muon.  Mean MeV/cm or mean PECorr/cm\\
MeV & Estimated energy deposited in the scintiallator calculated from PECorr using the results of the absolute calibration. Additional correction for dead material needs to be made in order to get a calorimetric energy estimate.
\end{tabular}

%The light is attenuated while traveling through the fiber. To find the correct energy of the incident particle these losses are corrected by using cosmic ray muons. The cosmic ray muons are used to calibrate the NOvA detectors because they provide a source of consistent energy across the detectors. The purpose of the attenuation calibration is to provide constants and formulae such that an amount of energy deposited in the detector and registered by an APD can be expressed in comparable units, PECorr which are the corrected photo-electrons (PE) no matter where the deposition occurred. Variations in time are to be handled by the drift calibration. The purpose of the absolute calibration is to provide a scaling factor, independent of channel since all of that variation should have been taken out by the relative calibration, so that energy deposits can be expressed in physically meaningful units (GeV).
%For both purposes cosmic rays are used as probes. For the attenuation calibration they represent a source of consistent energy deposits across the detector of approximately 1 minimum ionizing particle’s energy, MIP, but this is not assumed. Any average value consistent across the detector would do. For absolute calibration, stopping muons are used, whose precise energy deposits should be estimateable from the Bethe Bloch formula. [docdb:13579 - SA The Attenuation and Threshold Calibration of the NOvA detector, but a lot of this is actually just copied from Backhouse's original calibration technote docdb:7410]

%(Dividing data into periods and epochs) A new period is started for a major change to running conditions such as a horn current change, a long shutdown, target replacement, etc. Periods are divided into epochs. A new epoch is started whenever analysis or production reasons dictate. Calibration has been performed for all the periods separately and has used the data that are determined by the Data Quality group to be good. The effects of aging, temperature, partial filling, and cooling are neglected. The drift calibration should be able to account for all of these (but drift calibration doesn't really exist yet afaik). [docdb:13579 - SA The Attenuation and Threshold Calibration of the NOvA detector]

\subsubsection*{Creating calibration samples}

To select good quality cosmic ray muons we first remove beam related events based on their time stamp relative to the time of the beam spill, as shown on figure \ref{figRemoveBeamSpill}. Then we apply basic reconstruction and track-based selection.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Plots/RemoveTBSpills.pdf}
\caption{Test Beam beam spill events removed from the calibration samples. Test Beam beam spill is 4.2 seconds long and we remove events (in blue) within a 5 seconds window from the start of the beam spill. The remaining events (green) should mostly consist of cosmic particles. This example and the numbers of entries are for the full period 4 Test Beam sample.}
\label{figRemoveBeamSpill}
\end{figure}

Since energy deposition in a cell depends on the pathlength the particle traveled through the cell, we only use hits for which we can reliably calculate their pathlength. We call these hits \textbf{tricell} hits, as we require that all accepted hits also have a recorded hit in both neighboring cells of the same plane, as shown on figure \ref{figTricellCondition}. In case there's a bad channel in a neighboring cell, we ignore this channel and look one cell further. We can then calculate the pathlength simply as the cell width divided by the cosine of the direction angle \cite{NOVA-doc-13579,NOVA-doc-7410}.

\caption{Illustration of the tricell condition (a). We only use hits that have two surrounding hits in the same plane to be used in the NOvA calibration. This is to ensure a good quality of the pathlength (d) reconstruction, which is calculated from the known cell height (h) and the reconstructed track angle $\left(\varphi\right)$. In case the hit is next to a bad channel (b), we ignore this bad channel and require a hit in the next cell over.}
\label{figTricellCondition}
\end{figure}

%Do I even need to talk about the Z estimate, Avg estimate, or the 

%The first step in the attenuation calibration is to select the suitable hits from tracks of cosmic ray muons. Because a reliable estimate of pathlength is required, not all hits are suitable for use.  If a cell has each of its neighbors in the same plane hit, then we know, for a Y view cell, that the track entered through the upper wall, and exited through the lower wall. The pathlength then is just the width of the cell divided by the direction cosine. This selection also significantly decreases the chance that the hit in question is a noise hit. Allowance is made for neighboring dead cells, so e.g. “hit, dead, hit, hit” would still lead the 3rd cell to be selected. The second best hit selection, in cases where there are too many dead neighboring cells on each side, is the so-called “z” estimator, where a hit is required at the same cell number in each of the neighboring planes in the same view. The pathlength is then the ratio of cell depth to cz.[docdb:13579 - SA The Attenuation and Threshold Calibration of the NOvA detector, copied from docdb:7410]

%from docdb:7410: A requirement that the track be “throughgoing” (lowest endpoint outside the fiducial volume) was applied, but doesn’t make much difference. I think this selection was broken by the recent changes to StopperSelection anyway. (So it seems that it was required for the relative calibration that the muons are through-going, but I assume this was discarded somewhere down the line)

For the absolute calibration we select muons that stop in the detector. For this we identify muons with a Michel electron at the end of their track and only selection those \cite{NOVA-doc-13579-FACalorimetricEnergyScale}.

%Stopping muon selection (from docdb:13579 - FA\_Calorimetric\_energy\_scale): There are two avenues for selecting stopping muons; i) selecting tracks whose reconstructed end point is contained within the detector and ii) selecting tracks that have a Michel electron at one end. Michel electrons are useful for both identifying muons and effective tagging of the end point of muon tracks. The stopping selection requires the reconstructed end point of the muon track to be at least 50 cm from the detector edge. The identification of a Michel electron at the end of a muon track has two stages of both temporal and spatial range requirements. Firstly, a candidate Michel electron hit is required to occur between 1 and 30 microseconds after the mean time of the hits on the track. Furthermore, the candidate Michel electron must be within a 30 cm sphere surrounding the reconstructed track end point. The candidate Michel electron hit for a muon track is the hit that produces the largest detector response among the hits that pass the above cuts. Secondly, cell hits surrounding the candidate Michel electron hit are associated with the Michel electron if they occur within a 30 cm sphere surrounding the Michel electron candidate. Furthermore, to be associated with the Michel electron the cell hits must occur between 0.5 microseconds before and 0.5 microseconds after the candidate Michel electron. Michel electrons at the end of muon tracks are reconstructed using the candidate and associated Michel electron hits. The stopping muon selection requires a Michel electron at the end of the muon track.

For each data period/epoch and each simulation version we create two calibration samples that are used as the input for the relative and absolute calibration. The samples are called \cite{NOVA-doc-13579-CalibrationMetaREADFIRST}
\begin{itemize}
\item pclist = \textbf{list} of \textbf{p}re-\textbf{c}alibrated hist; Contains all selected cosmic muon events and is used in the relative calibration;
\item pcliststop = pclist files only containing stopping muons used for the absolute calibration 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Fiber brightness}

For data, the relative calibration is done for each individual cell in each plane to properly account for any potential variations. Therefore we have to repeat the attenuation fit $N_{cell}\times N_{plane}$ times. However, generating enough simulated events would be very computationaly intensive. Additionally, we can assume that the simulated detector is approximately uniform plane to plane. Therefore, for simulation, we want to \textit{consolidate} the detector planes and only consider variation in the two views and their cells, so repeat the fit $N_{cell}\times N_{view}$ times \cite{NOVA-doc-13579-SAAttenuationAndThreshold,NOVA-doc-34909}.

There are some variations in the detector response cell by cell, that can be caused by different fiber brightnesses, but also by different qualities of the scintillator, air bubbles, APD gains, looped or zipped fibers and potentially others. To emulate these differences in the simulation without the need to simulate every cell individually and properly, we divide all the cells of each detector into 12 brightness bins, as shown on figure \ref{figFiberBrightnessBins}. These bins describe the relative differences in the detector response between individual cells \cite{NOVA-doc-34909}. Therefore in the end, for simulation we perform the attenuation fit in the $N_{view}\times N_{fiber brightness bin}\times N_{cell}$ phase space.

%Do I need to describe here how we do it or is it enough if I just say that we do?
%To divide the detector into brightness bins, we use the results of the attenuation fit and look at the fitted response at cell centre, which should represent the average response in that cell. Then we normalize the

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Threshold and shielding correction}

Energy deposited far away from the readout may get attenuated enough to be shifted below the threshold. These low energy depositions would be mising from the attenuation fit, biasing it towards larger light levels going away from the readout. A similar effect, specifically for the vertical cells, is caused by using cosmic muons for calibration. The top of the detector effectively shields the bottom of the detector, skewing the energy distribution of cosmic muons. To correct for both of these effect, we use simulation to calculate the threshold and shielding (also called threshold and shadowing) correction by comparing the true and reconstructed information. We apply this correction before the attenuation fits \cite{NOVA-doc-13579-SAAttenuationAndThreshold}.

%Should I write anything more? Maybe about how do we calculate this more specifically, or that it's done for view X fb bin X cell X w

%In the Far Detector data and MC a large divergence between calibrated and true energies as a function of W was observed [8]. This was traced back to the much longer cell lengths in the FD meaning that thresholds play a large role at the foot of a cell. Also self-shielding of the detector by its own mass lay a role in the observed discrepancy. Thresholds mean that for a hit to be seen by an APD, it may need to have a slight upwards fluctuation in the number of photons produced by the energy deposition. Self-shielding means that the average visible energy depositions from MIPs are not truly spatially uniform in the detector. If not corrected for these effects, there will be a bias in the set of hits that the attenuation fit sees, and leads it to overestimate the light-level, and so under-estimate real hit energies by tens of percent. The approach adopted to solve this problem was to create a correction factor as a function of view, cell, and position along the cell which would be applied before the attenuation correction to remove the effect of thresholds and shielding. To this end MC truth information about the calibration hit sample is used to create a combined threshold and shadowing correction for each cell and view combination,
%\begin{equation}
%T=\frac{PE}{\lambda}\frac{E_{true}}{E_{mip}},
%\end{equation}
%where $T$ is the combined “threshold and shielding” correction factor, $PE$ is the simulated photoelectrons recorded at the readout, $\lambda$ is the number of simulated photons which would be seen at the readout out in the absence of fluctuations, $E_{true}$ is the true energy deposited in the cell and $E_{mip}$ is the naive energy you would expect to be deposited based on the pathlength through the cell. In this way it encodes a threshold correction based on the simulated readout PE with and without the fluctuations, with $\lambda$ dependent on your simulated threshold, as well as a shielding correction based on the simulated energy deposition and a naive no shielding approximation. This equation gives us a cell by cell correction but we use an empirical polynomial fit to that distribution which removes statistical noise from the correction and well describes the initial distribution. This correction factor is applied to the cell by cell data and MC PE/cm distributions before the attenuation fits. [docdb:13579 - SA The Attenuation and Threshold Calibration of the NOvA detector, reference 8 is for docdb:7247, a talk by Backhouse]

\subsection{Relative calibration}

%Detailed description can be found in the "Instructions for the Attenuation Calibration Job" technote from Prabhjot from docdb:13579 (list of all calibration technotes) and on the relative calibration wiki page.

Relative calibration aims to create a fit, called \textit{attenuation fit}, to the detector response over the position in a cell separately for every cell inside each detector. Scaling the fitted response to match the "average response" of the detector effectively removes relative differences throughout and between all cells across the entire detector. This average response is a single number chosen to approximately represent the average response in the middle of the cell. For the Far Detector this number is 39.91 PE, for the Near Detector it's 37.51 and for Test Beam it's the same as for the Far Detector 39.91. The scale of this number has no impact of this result as the absolute scale of the detector response is determined during the absolute calibration \cite{NOVA-doc-7410,NOVA-doc-13579-SAAttenuationAndThreshold}.
 
To create the attenuation fit we follow the following procedure \cite{NOVA-doc-7410}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create \textit{attenuation profiles}, which are profile histograms of detector response in terms of energy deposited per pathlength (PE/cm) as a function of position in the cell (w) through each cell for all planes. We construct the attenuation profiles over a little wider range than the actual length of the cell and alway with 100 bins for each detector. This means that smaller detectors, like the Test Beam detector, have a finer binning ($\sim 3\unit{cm}$/bin) compared to the Far Detector ($\sim 18\unit{cm}$/bin).
\item Analyse the attenuation profiles. The job to create the attenuation profiles also creates validation histograms, which should be analyzed prior to performing the attenuation fit to make sure the attenuation profiles look as expected.
\item Apply the threshold and shielding correction that were created using the simulation pclist sample before the relative calibration.
\item Do the attenuation fit over the full length of each cell. The fit consists of
\begin{enumerate}
\item exponential fit, which combines two cases. Light from the energy deposition traveling straight to the readout, or going the opposite direction, looping around the cell and then to the readout. The fitted function has a form:\\
\begin{equation}
y=C+A\left(\exp\left(\frac{w}{X}\right)+\exp\left(-\frac{L+w}{X}\right)\right),
\end{equation}
where $y$ is the response, $L$ is the length of the cell and $C$, $A$ and $X$ are the fitted parameters. $X$ also represents the attenuation length.
\item To remove the effect of residuals, mainly at the end of cells, we smooth out the residuals from the exponential fit with LOcally WEighted Scatter plot Smoothing (LOWESS).
\end{enumerate}
\item Check the plots of the attenuation fit for a selection of cells.
\item Save the fit result to the databese in the form of two csv tables. The \textit{calib\_atten\_consts.csv} table holds the results of the exponential fit, together with the final $\chi^2$ of the fit. The \textit{calib\_atten\_points.csv} table holds the results of the LOWESS smoothing.
\end{enumerate}

To ensure the quality of the attenuation fit, we only apply the results if the final $\chi^2<0.2$. If $\chi^2>0.2$ we ignore the results for this cell and mark it as \textit{uncalibrated}.

%Attenutation profiles have a constant binnin fNBins=100 (in w), same for ND, FD and TB. This results in an effectively finer binning for TB compared to ND and FD. For FD w = (-900,+900), ND: (-250,+250), TB: (-150,+150). TB: 3cm/bin, ND: 5cm/bin, FD: 18cm/bin. What effect could this have on the relative calibration results? Particularly on the calibration shape?

%where y is the response, L is the cell length, C, A and X are the free parameters in the fit. X gives the attenuation length as well. Initially, the fit is to the central part of the cell, which is different for each detector. In addition to the approximately quartic behavior at the ends of every channel there are in many channels fairly large residuals. They don’t appear to follow any consistent pattern. The leading hypothesis is that these are due to varying fiber position within the cell. Usually the fiber lies in the corners of the cell, but if it is somehow twisted so that it rises into the center of the cell, then it should collect more light, to an extent comparable to what is seen here. To remove such an irregular pattern, the residual from the analytic fit is simply fit with LOcally WEighted Scatter plot Smoothing, LOWESS. The LOWESS curve at each point is formed from the weighted mean of the deviations. The weighting function is the traditional tri-cube, (insert equation, likely not needed for this technote) [docdb:13579 - SA The Attenuation and Threshold Calibration of the NOvA detector, already in 1stAna and Backhouse's technote]

%For NDOS the fit was a very little bit different, where we didn't use $L$ but $3L/2$. Also it says that "Over the length of an NDOS cell, the effect of the long attenuation length is imperceptible, and is modelled as a constant (If you put a long attenuation term in, the fit drives the length scale to infinity anyway). [docdb:7410]

%In many channels, fairly large residuals are visible. They don’t appear to follow any consistent pattern. The hypothesis is that these are due to varying fibre position within the cell. Usually the fibre lies in the corners of the cell, but if it is somehow twisted so that it rises into the centre of the cell, then it should collect more light, to an extent comparable to what is seen here. To remove such an irregular pattern, the residual from the analytic fit is simply fit with LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing). The LOWESS curve at each point is formed from the weighted mean of the deviations. The weighting function is the traditional tri-cube:
%\begin{equation}
%w_i=\left(1-\left|\frac{x-x_i}{\sigma}\right|^3\right)^3.
%\end{equation}
%The smoothing length scale $\sigma$ is 30cm. 20 points calculated by this method are stored, to be linearly interpolated between to approximate the full LOWESS curve. If the LOWESS fit at any point exceeds 15\% the original attenuation fit was very bad, and the channel is marked uncalibrated. Figure 4 shows an example of large (10\%) deviations being fitted. This variation is not seen in the MC, and so the LOWESS fit is skipped there. Due to the lower stats available in MC, instead of being collated by plane and cell, the curves are only calculated by view and cell. [docdb:7410]

%The current value of $\sigma$ in the code is $1.5\times\textsf{DetWidth}/20$

\subsection{Absolute calibration}

To find the absolute energy scale, we apply the relative calibration results on the stopping muon sample and look at the energy they deposited in cells 1-2 meters from the end of their tracks. In this track window they are minimum ionising particels and their energy deposition is almost constant and well understood. We take a mean of their corrected deposited energy separate for each view and for each calibrated sample. We then take the average over the two views to get the final $\textsf{MEU}_{reco} \unit{PECorr/cm}$ for each sample \cite{NOVA-doc-13579-FACalorimetricEnergyScale}.

From simulation we get the mean of the true energy deposited in scintillator $\textsf{MEU}_{truth} \unit{MeV/cm}$ for the same sample of stopping muons. We ignore the energy that's lost in the dead material (PVC extrusions) and deal with it separately. The absolute energy scale for each sample is then the ratio of $\textsf{MEU}_{truth}/\textsf{MEU}_{reco}$. We save these absolute energy scales in another csv table called \textit{calib\_abs\_consts.csv} which stores the $\textsf{MEU}$ values and their errors.

As part of the absolute calibration we also produce validation plots that show the effect of calibration on the distribution of the stopping muons. We analyse these plots and if everything looks all right load all the csv tables into the database.

%Stopping muons provide a good sample of known energy deposits. If we can collect a “golden” sample, they should provide the scale factor to convert PECorr to GeV. So far, the method used has been imperfect, and the absolute calibration constants are known to be off by approx. 10\%. Since a factor already has to be derived to correct for dead material, this is not significantly impeding current efforts, but work was recently gone into improving this area. [docdb:7410 - this was likely before the track window cut was introduced] (Here it says that it's not such a big a problem since we have to scale for the dead material anyway. But nowadays we have to account for a large systematic uncertainty in the absolute energy scale in our analyses. How is the dead material correction different from the energy scale uncertainty?)

%...the calibration of the calorimetric energy scale of the NOvA detectors uses the energy deposited by stopping muons as a standard candle. To reduce systematic uncertainties, only those energy deposits in a 1-2 m window away from the muon track end point are used. The mean of the detector response distribution is found for data and MC in both near and far detectors. The mean of the distribution of true energy deposits in the track window is used to provide a conversion factor between the detector response and the true energy deposited in the scintillator for minimum ionising muons. The simulated dE/dx is uniform within about 1.8\% for hits around the minimum between 100-200 cm from the track end. The energy that a muon deposits within each cell is estimated using Geant 4 and stored in Fibre Liquid Scintillator (FLS) hits. FLS hits are only those within the active material (liquid scintillator) and energy loss within the passive material (plastic extrusions) is ignored. an estimate of the minimum energy loss rate of stopping muons in the NOvA scintillator is found to be,
%\begin{equation}
%\left.\frac{dE}{dx}\right|_{\textsf{mip}}=\left(1.7915\pm 0.0035\right)\unit{MeV/cm}.
%\end{equation}
%For stopping muons in NOvA it is also important to consider their decay. The muon has a vacuum lifetime of about 2.2 microseconds and favourably decays, with a branching ratio approx. 100\%, into an electron, an electron anti-neutrino and a muon neutrino. The electron produced in this decay is called a Michel electron and is used to select muons that stop within the NOvA detectors. The energy scale calibration is performed using cosmic ray muons. The calibration measures the detector response in data and MC in both near and far detectors and normalises them all by providing a conversion factor, for all four cases, that converts the detector response to energy in GeV. The energy loss rate (dE/dx) of stopping muons is well described by the Bethe-Bloch and is a function of the distance from the stopping point. A track window technique is used to minimise the variations in detector response that depend on the distance to the track end. Using this technique only hits within a region of distances from the track end are used. The position of the track window is chosen such that a mis-reconstruction of the track end point has the minimum effect on the mean detector response. The track window is currently set to be in the range from 100 cm to 200 cm from the track end.[docdb:13579 - FA\_Calorimetric\_energy\_scale]

%In the First Analysis  An adjustment was made to the value for the ND data to lower the value of PECorr/cm by about 3.6\%. The adjustment was made based on studies of muons from beam neutrinos interacting in the detector where it was observed that the average beam muon response was 3.6\% lower in data than in MC [8]. For the FD There is a discrepancy in the distributions of PECorr/cm in data and MC; the mean of the distribution is higher in data than in MC. This may be due to mis-modelling of the detector response in the MC. In any case, the data-MC PECorr/cm discrepancy is tuned out when the calorimetric energy scale is applied. [docdb:13579 - FA\_Calorimetric\_energy\_scale]

%% Applying the calibration inside Calibrator
%The calibration constants are written to the database tables calib atten consts and calib atten points. The calib atten consts table contains the seven free parameters in the attenuation fit, plus identifying information. The calib atten points table contains the 20 LOWESS points for each cell, with one point per row. When a request comes to Calibrator to create a RecoHit, usually from a RecoBase object that has provided a W value based on a straight-line extrapolation of its trajectory, ultimately we end up in Calibrator::GetPECorr. This retrieves an AttenCurve object from a cache we hold of all the database values, which can calculate the mean response to cosmic rays at any position. The calibrated energy deposit is then the PE in the CellHit divided by this average cosmic ray response. A correction factor taken from the absolute calibration, also stored in the database, is applied to the answer to give the resulting PECorr. Calibrator also stores the quality of the calibration fit for a given cell such that if we fail to calibrate a cell in the Data to a sufficient quality that cell will not return a calibrated energy in both Data and Monte Carlo. Calibrator also returns the MIP and GeV scales that are described in the accompanying absolute calibration technote. [docdb:13579 - SA The Attenuation and Threshold Calibration of the NOvA detector] ...The calibrated energy deposit is then the PE in the CellHit divided by this average cosmic ray responseAn eyeballed factor of 75 is applied to the answer to give the resulting PECorr about the same size as the input PE (this is the factor (originally) used) [docdb:7410]

%%% Validation of calibration results
From Calibration\_Meta\_READFIRST.pdf:
Validations	of any calibration correction take the same basic form:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What deficency are you correcting for? (For Test Beam this would be the difference between the different scintillators, also the faulty FEBs, distribution of w is not flat, especially in the overfilled cells. The energy response between the different cells and planes is not the same. Maybe I should talk about this for each period separately when I have the calibhist plots which show the non-linearities. Also the PhotonTransport plots don't really show the PECorr but the PE/cm itself but with the fit!!!
\item What correction factors/scales have you found? Show them in plot form. (This is basically the PhotonTransport plots for the relative calibration and the pecorrcm distributions for the absolute calibration)
\item Now generate the same plots as in (1) but with the corrections applied. Technically this is the absolute calibration validation plots. Does this mean that the PE/cm plots from the absolute calibration should be/are exactly the same as the calibhist plots? Not entirely as those are only for the stopping muons, whereas the calibhist are for the through-going muons. Does it mean I should maybe generate the calibhist plots with the relative calibration applied?
\item Ratios of plots in (3) to (1) to highlight any patterns or difficult-to-spot discrpancies between what we think should happen when the constants are applied, and what does happen. But what does this tell us? It's basically just an average of the attenuation correction...
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Calibration uncertainties}

WORK IN PROGRESS

%First Analysis systematic uncertainties due to calibration:
%Sources of systematic uncertainty of particular concern are those introduced by residual variations remaining after calibration. Systematic errors are introduced by spatial and temporal variations in detector response. Further, any difference between the two detectors may introduce a relative shift in the energy scale between the detectors. A source of systematic uncertainty can be introduced by mis-reconstructing the end point of the muon track. Such a mis-reconstruction would shift the window within which hits are selected and hence the dE/dx of the muon.  The figure shows that the detector response varies by up to about 60\% over the range from 0 to 500 cm to the track end. This large variation illustrates the importance of careful consideration of the track window position and size. The detector response for both data and MC is minimum at about 130 cm from the track end and is flat to about 1\% in the range from 100 cm to 200 cm from the track end. For a track window starting at 100 cm from the track end, a conservative mis-reconstruction of the track end point by 10cm will shift the start of the track window to between 90cm and 110cm. This shift will alter the MEU value by less than 0.4\% over the range.
%If the calibration procedure was ideal the detector response would not vary with position in either data or MC. The calibration is not ideal and the detector response and recorded simulated energy deposition varies with position of the hit within the detector, such variations will introduce systematic errors. The position of a hit can be defined by the plane, cell within the plane, and distance along the cell (w) of the hit. The variation in detector response and simulated energy deposition vs. plane, cell and w for each view has been studied to quantify the systematic uncertainty introduced by these sources.
%The rise in detector response at the far end of FD y-view cells is an issue with several potential sources. The rise in response may be due to an acceptance effect or a light-level threshold effect among other possibilities. An acceptance effect is where greater energy must be deposited at the far end of the cells so that the light can travel along the fibre, hit the APD and be recorded as a hit. Both an acceptance effect and a light-level effect would introduce a bias towards higher energy hits toward the far end of cells.
%Another source of systematic uncertainty is introduced by the variation in detector response with time. The FD response is stable to about 1\% during the period from October 2014 to March 2015. The ND response needs further study but there was no significant trend over 6 months at 5\%. 
%As mentioned in Section 5, the version (7.1) of the calibration used for first analysis has been adjusted based on studies of muons from beam neutrinos interacting in the detector [8]. A shift of 3.6\% was introduced based on the average response of muons where large sections of the track were used. When only a track window of 100-200cm is used on the beam muons the difference is only 2.7\% [8]. Our best hypothesis for this residual 2.7\% difference is that it is caused by showery events that are present in ND data but not ND MC: it was shown in [9] that doing the calorimetric energy scale calibration using a truncated mean (or a median or a fit to the peak) gave a data/MC ratio that differed by 2.7\% compared to using the untruncated mean as described in this document. A comparison of various cross checks of the calorimetric energy scale was undertaken (in [10] and [11]) and concluded that the nearly 5\% difference between ND data and MC seen in a sample of Michele electrons [12] should be applied as both an absolute and relative shift to the calorimetric energy scale. The difference between the level of calorimetric energy resolution of stopping muons was studied and it was found that data and MC agreed best when an 8\% additional smearing was introduced. Studies for the NuMu analysis indicated that this was a negligible systematic uncertainty [13].

\section{NOvA Test Beam detector calibration}
\subsection{Overview}
History of TB calibration. What led to the final version of TB calibration. What can be done next. I think this could also be in the introduction?

Dates and times when the data taking occured.

Adding the underfilled cells to the bad channels which are automatically skipped for the tricell condition

Period naming, possibly epochs (for P3).
List of data samples, plus MC samples that were used and pointer to the data-based simulation technote.
%Possibly refer to https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/novatestbeam/wiki/Period_and_Epoch_Naming

Specific running conditions: - maybe enough to mention this in the individual descriptions of the test beam periods
Underfilled cells
Faulty FEBs (Period 2 and Period 3)

Why do we do the calibration generally and why do we need to do in for Test Beam specifically - probably in the introduction

Temperature study (small overview)

From Teresa's thesis
Along with setting the energy scale of the detector, we need to calibrate the timing of the readout system for the detector. The Data Concentrator Modules (DCMs) responsible for collating the data from multiple FEBs get their timing information via a daisy chain originating at the detector TDU. Each DCM in the chain has a timing offset relative to the DCM before it, with the last DCM having the earliest ti. Following the procedure described in [66], I used timing information from hits on cosmic ray muon tracks that pass through multiple DCMs to determine the relative offsets between DCMs, shown in Figure 3.20.

\subsubsection{Definitions}
List all final data and simulation definitions used.

Mention exactly the name and the location of the fcl files to create the TB pclist/pcliststop files.

When were these files produced? Mention that we had to reprocess most of the files in 2023 due to the changed geometry.

From Teresa's thesis:
"For Test Beam, we have three beam-based triggers, one pulsed trigger, and two data-driven triggers. The data-driven triggers are both activity-based triggers. The first is intended to record cosmic ray induced events for use in calibrating the detector.

\subsection{Fiber Brightness}

To divide the Test Beam detector into fiber brightness bins we used the attenuation fit results for period 4 data (described in section \ref{secTBPeriod4}).

Describe and show plots that since we are only using the fitted response at cell centre we can allow fits with $\chi^2>0.2$. Show examples of responses with chisq larger than that and say what is the final chisq chosen. No need to show the final distribution of the fb bins here as they were technically shown in the general calibration description. But might refer back to it...

\label{figFiberBrightnessExamples}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulation}

We originally used Teresa's calibration MC sample, but after we saw disagreement, we developed a new MC based off of the period 3 data, which we ended up using for both period 2 and period 3. For fibre brightness we are also using the same MC from period 3 data as it represents the detector in its best condition.

We used a data-based simulation of cosmic muons for the Test Beam detector calibration. The details are described in the technote XXX. We used this and this data as a basis and this and this data for the fiber brighness file.

\subsection{Threshold and shielding corrections}
The threshold and shielding correction for test beam is almost uniform across all cells as can be seen on figure... This is expected as the hight of the Test Beam detector of 2.6m has only a negligible effect on the energy distribution of cosmic muons or on the threshold saturation. The correction is basically just a normalization factor, but since the relative calibration only cares about relative differences across the detector, a normalization factor doesn't change anything.

Only a month of data, only first half of detector filled, primary/secondary beam halo, or oversaturation leading to FEB shutoffs [docdb:38349 and 41331].
Only used for comissioning, not used for any data analysis or calibration.

\subsection{Period 2}
What was done for the period 2 tb calibration, short overview of what has been done: test beam data were calibrated all at the same time without splitting them to separate epochs. See figures \ref{figCalibhistWPE_period2},\ref{figCalibhistCellPE_period2} and \ref{figCalibhistPlanePE_period2}.
